- What is Virtual DOM?
  - lightweight JavaScript object which originally is just the copy of the real DOM
  - Virtual DOM works in three simple steps
    - Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation
    - Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated
    - Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed
- What is the difference between Virtual DOM and DOM?
  - Updating the real DOM is very expensive and slow
  - Real DOM can directly update HTML
  - Creates a new DOM if Real DOM's element updates, but Virtual DOM updates only the updated elements
- What is the difference between Element and Component?
  - Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components
  - Elements can contain other Elements in their props
  - Creating a React element is cheap
  - Elements are immutable
  - Components are functions or classes that optionally accept inputs and return a React element
  - Components can refer to other components in their output
  - React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements
- What is the difference between state and props?
- React Elements vs React Components
- React Element vs DOM Element
