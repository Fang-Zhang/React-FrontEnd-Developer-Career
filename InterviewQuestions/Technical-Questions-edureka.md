- What are the advantages of React.js?
  - Easy to learn
  - Reusable components
  - Virtual DOM
  - Performance
- What are the limitations of React.js?
  - Only UI library, not a full framework
  - Uses inline templating and JSX
  - React.js is unopinionated
- What is JSX?
  - JavsScript XML
  - Syntax extension to JavaScript
  - Write HTML inside JavaScript
  - JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children
  - JSX is not a necessity to write React applications
  - JSX makes React a lot more elegant and straightforward
- What is Virtual DOM?
  - lightweight JavaScript object which originally is just the copy of the real DOM
  - Virtual DOM works in three simple steps
    - Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation
    - Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated
    - Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed
- What is the difference between Virtual DOM and DOM?
  - Updating the real DOM is very expensive and slow
  - Real DOM can directly update HTML
  - Creates a new DOM if Real DOM's element updates, but Virtual DOM updates only the updated elements
- What is the difference between Element and Component?
  - Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components
  - Elements can contain other Elements in their props
  - Creating a React element is cheap
  - Elements are immutable
  - Components are functions or classes that optionally accept inputs and return a React element
  - Components can refer to other components in their output
  - React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements
- What is the difference between state and props?
- React Elements vs React Components
- React Element vs DOM Element
- Why can't browsers read JSX?
  - JSX isn't a regular JavaScript, browsers can only read JavaScript objects
  - Babel converts JSX into JavaScript objects
- How are errors handled in React.js
  - React uses error boundaries to handle errors
  - Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed
  - Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them
### React.js Component Questions
- What is a React.js component?
  - Components are the building blocks of any React application
  - Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model
  - Components are independent and reusable bits of code
  - Components can be defined as class-based or functional components
- What are the different phases of React.js component's lifecycle?
  - Initialization
  - Mounting
  - Updating
  - Unmounting
- What is the difference between a class component and functional component?
  - Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component
  - Functional components are functions
  - Class components can have state, functional components can't
  - Class components have a render method, functional components don't
  - Class components can have refs, functional components can't
  - Class components can have context, functional components can't
  - Class components can have lifecycle methods, functional components can't
- What do you understand from "In React, everything is a component"?
  - Components are the building blocks of any React application
  - Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model
  - Components are independent and reusable bits of code
  - Components can be defined as class-based or functional components
- Explain the purpose of render() in React.js
  - render() is the most important method in a React Component
  - render() function returns a React element which is a lightweight description of what to render
  - render() function is a must for every React component
  - render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser
- Differentiate between States and Props
  - Props are used to pass data and event handlers down to child components
  - Props are immutable
  - States are used to change the component's state
  - States are mutable
- What's the arrow function? How to use it?
  - Arrow functions are more concise than traditional function expressions
  - Arrow functions are always anonymous
  - Arrow functions do not have their own this
  - Arrow functions are not hoisted
- What's the Fragment in React.js?
  - Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM
  - Fragments are a common pattern in React
- What's the Context in React.js?
  - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, it's the alternative to "prop drilling".
  - Context is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components
- What's the Refs in React.js?
  - Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method
- What's the key in React.js?
  - Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
  - Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
  - Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings
- How to modularize code in React.js?
  - React.js is a component-based library
  - Components are the building blocks of any React application
- What's the Higer-Order-Components?
  - Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature
  - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component
  - HOCs can be used to abstract away repetitive tasks
  - HOCs can be used to compose multiple components to create more complex functionality
  - HOCs can be used to share common functionality between components
### React.js Redux Questions
- What're the major problems with MVC framework?
  - MVC is not a genuine component-based architecture
- Explain Flux
  - Flux is an application architecture for React applications
  - Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional
  - Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your views and data in sync
  - Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your logic and views decoupled
  - Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your components light
- What's the Redux?
  - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
  - Redux is a state management tool
- Redux vs Flux
  - Flux is a pattern, Redux is a library
  - Flux has multiple stores, Redux has a single store
  - Flux has a dispatcher, Redux has no dispatcher
  - Flux has multiple actions, Redux has a single action
- What're the three principles Redux follows?
  - Single source of truth
  - State is read-only
  - Changes are made with pure functions
- What's the meaning of "Single source of truth"?
  - The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store
  - The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application
  - Single source of truth also enables powerful developer tools
- List the components of Redux
  - Action: a plain object that represents an intention to change the state
  - Reducer: a function that takes the current state and an action and returns a new state
  - Store: an object that holds the application's state tree
  - View: the UI of the application
- Show the flow of Redux
  - You call store.dispatch(action)
  - The Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it
  - The root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree
  - The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer
- How Actions are defined in Redux?
  - Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store
  - Actions are plain JavaScript objects
  - Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed
  - Types should typically be defined as string constants
  - Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module
  - Actions can contain a payload
  - Actions are created by action creators
- Explain the role of Reducer
  - Reducers take the previous state and an action, and return the next state
  - Reducers are pure functions
  - Reducers are the only way to change the state
  - Reducers must not mutate the state
- Explain the significance of Store in Redux
  - In Redux, the entire state of your application is stored in an object tree inside a single store
  - The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened
  - To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers
  - You can subscribe to the changes to the data in the store
  - You can unsubscribe from the changes to the data in the store
###   React.js Hooks Questions
- What are React Hooks?
  - Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components
  - Hooks don't work inside classes
  - Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props
- What are the rules for Hooks?
  - Only call Hooks at the top level
  - Only call Hooks from React function components
- What are the advantages of Hooks?
  - Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy
  - Hooks allow you to split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related
  - Hooks allow you to share reusable stateful logic between components
- Any techniques to optimize React App Perfomance from Hooks perspective?
  - Using useMemo() to memoize expensive functions so that they only recompute when their dependencies change
- What's the useState()?
  - useState() is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components
  - useState() returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it
  - useState() is similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn't merge the old and new state together
- What's the useContext()?
  - useContext() is a Hook that allows you to use React context in function components
  - useContext() accepts a context object and returns the current context value for that context
  - The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the calling component in the tree
- What's the useRef()?
  - useRef() is a Hook that returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue)
  - The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component
  - useRef() is handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes
  - useRef() will not cause a component to re-render when its return value changes
- What's the useReducer()?
  - useReducer() is a Hook that accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches a function
  - useReducer() is usually preferable to useState() when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one
  - useReducer() also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks
  - useReducer() will not cause a component to re-render when its return value changes
### React.js Router Questions
- What's the React Router?
  - React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application
  - React Router is a standard library for routing in React
  - React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL
### React.js Performance Questions
- What are the ways to improve React.js performance?
  - Use the production build
  - Use the key prop correctly
  - Avoid using indexes as keys
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Use the React Profiler
  - Use the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method
  - Use the P
